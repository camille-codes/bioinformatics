Projects under this repository:
* DNA_analysis - This program counts the number of nucleotides present in the DNA, transcribe the DNA to RNA, and return the complement DNA strand.
* FAST_CG_Proportion - This program calculates the proportion of CG in DNA samples of files in FASTA format
* Translating_RNA_to_Protein - This program translates RNA to protein as well as counts CG proportion of the DNA samples. Input files must be in FASTA format. Data can be optionally saved to .csv if prompted from the program.
